# Dispixel
A lightweight, easy to use bot for Discord that fetches player stats from the Hypixel API. Powered by a custom javascript wrapper for the [Hypixel API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hypixeljs).
## Usage
To run this you can either host it yourself which is absolutely fine or invite Dispixel to your [server](https://thorindev.co.uk/dispixel.html). If you would like to run your own version follow these steps.
1. Clone the repo to your machine of choice.
2. Choose which branch you would like to run it off. *Master* is the stable branch that doesn\'t contain bugs. *Develop* the latest features but they may break.
3. Put your tokens and keys into `key.json` and then run `node app.js` or use `pm2` like me!
4. Profit?
