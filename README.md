A lightweight, easy to use bot for Discord that fetches player stats from the Hypixel API.
## Built With
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

Original version was a collaboration between [Dance](https://github.com/Dance-Dog) and I. 
## Deployment
Dispixel has three versions of themselves:
- [Dispixel](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=495344911374221332&scope=bot&permissions=0): deployed when a release is created
- [Dispixel Development](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=958094389610156113&scope=bot&permissions=0): deployed when the `main` branch is pushed - contains the latest features but may break!
